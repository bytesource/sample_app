# Updating the Schema
# Associations are extremely useful, but they are not magic. 
# You are responsible for maintaining your database schema to match your associations. 
# In practice, this means two things, depending on what sort of associations you are creating. 
# For belongs_to associations you need to create foreign keys, 
# and for has_and_belongs_to_many associations you need to create the appropriate join table.
#
# If you create an association some time after you build the underlying model, 
# you need to remember to create an add_column migration to provide the necessary foreign key.
#
# Methods Added by belongs_to
# association(force_reload = false)
# association=(associate)
# build_association(attributes = {})
# create_association(attributes = {})
# 
# build_association(attributes = {})
# This object will be instantiated from the passed attributes, 
# and the link through this objectâ€™s foreign key will be set, 
# but the associated object will NOT yet be saved.
# 
# create_association(attributes = {})
# The associated object will be saved (assuming that it passes any validations).
